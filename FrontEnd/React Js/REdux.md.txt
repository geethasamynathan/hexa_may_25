# 🧠 What is Redux?

**Redux** is a **state management library** for JavaScript applications (mostly used with React). It helps you manage and share **application state (data)** across components in a predictable way.

- Think of Redux as a **central data store**.
- Components can read from it or send actions to update it.

> 🎯 Redux follows a principle: **“Single source of truth.”** Your app state is stored in one place (the Redux store), making it easier to debug, manage, and scale.

# 🕰️ When to Use Redux?

Use Redux **when your app has complex state logic**, such as:

- **Multiple components need the same data** (e.g., user info, theme, cart).
- You need to **persist state** across routes.
- You want to **debug or track every state change**.
- Your app has **dynamic UI behavior** based on multiple pieces of state.

## ✅ Suitable Scenarios:

- E-commerce site (cart, user, wishlist)
- Admin dashboard (filters, roles, settings)
- Social media app (likes, posts, comments, user auth)
- Large-scale enterprise apps with complex data flows

|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Centralized State   | One place to store app data                                             |
| 🔁 Predictable Updates | Changes happen via pure functions (reducers)                            |
| 🛠️ Debuggable          | Easily trace how state changes over time                               |
| 👥 Share State Easily  | No more prop-drilling (passing data between multiple component levels)  |
| 📦 Ecosystem Support   | Middleware, DevTools, and more                                          |

# 🌍 Real-World Example: E-commerce Shopping Cart

Let’s imagine an e-commerce React app. Here’s how Redux would be helpful:

## Problem Without Redux:

- The **Cart component**, **Navbar**, and **Checkout page** all need access to cart items.
- Passing cart data from top to bottom via props becomes messy.
- State is duplicated in multiple components.

## With Redux:

1. You store the `cartItems` in a central **Redux store**.
2. Components like `Cart`, `Navbar`, `ProductList`, and `Checkout` **connect to the Redux store** using `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.
3. Any update (e.g., add/remove item) triggers a `dispatch(action)` → Redux updates the state → UI updates everywhere automatically.

### Redux Flow (Simplified):
